# Implementation Support

The initial stage is difficult for every standard. Partly as a result of the well-known phenomenon of network effects, many will be cautious and wait before they implement. This cycle is difficult to break, but implementation support can be a decisive factor.  

At the same time, the first implementations are often also the first serious test case for the standards. Information about these implementations provides valuable input for the management process for a standard. This is all the more reason to provide implementation support.  
Furthermore, the first implementations will not always go well. The implementation burden can also be fairly high, and every effort must be made to prevent a standard entering the records as difficult and expensive to implement.  

Implementation support is therefore an excellent means of encouraging first implementation, keeping the implementation costs relatively low and increasing the quality of the implementations. It also has a mutual effect; for the standardisation organisation it is a unique opportunity to gather input about the quality of the standard and/or determine whether there are improvement points that need to be addressed.  

It often soon becomes clear that implementation support is necessary, but it often proves difficult to provide. In particular because a balance needs to be found between the role fulfilled by the management organisation and what should be left to consultancy by commercial businesses. It is not desirable for the management organisation to be seen as a competitor.  

A helpdesk functionality is the minimum requirement for a management organisation. It is in fact becoming increasingly common for the community to be used as a helpdesk. Take for example the Geoforum ([https://geoforum.nl/](https://geoforum.nl/)) to which questions can be submitted about geostandards.

By offering training, you as a management organisation quickly find yourself treading on the toes of others. Nevertheless it may prove essential to offer training in the initial stages, above all to increase the quality of the implementations, and to reduce the barriers to implementation.

With this in mind, it can be useful to develop open source modules. These create more implementation options, greater freedom and possibly easier implementations. Such a move also often forces the hand of suppliers, and as a management organisation, they place you directly in the territory of suppliers. Not all suppliers will be happy with your presence, but they nonetheless all remain vitally necessary to the successful adoption of the standard. As such, module development is an activity that must be tackled very carefully, and should only be considered if problems emerge in respect of implementation.

A lower threshold option is to organise pilots. By placing these pilot programmes in the promotional spotlight, a management organisation can create drive among the affected stakeholders. After all, it creates an innovative image. Pilots are above all appropriate for new (versions of) standards and can only be implemented on a limited scale.

In a previous section we already considered the subject of certification in detail. Above all a lighter form of certification, namely validation, is an excellent form of implementation support. In the initial phase, it is sensible not to publish the validation results; this makes it nothing more than a tool for suppliers to test and improve the implementations. But that is a good thing. At a later stage, more openness can be encouraged, together with a form of naming and shaming: which supplier achieves good results during validation and which does not? As such, the process automatically shifts more towards certification.

Validation makes you as the management organisation an adjudicator; in particular if differences of opinion arise about the correct use of a standard. On the one hand this is an ideal role, but on the other it places you as management organisation between the other parties, whereas a position above or alongside those parties is more desirable.
