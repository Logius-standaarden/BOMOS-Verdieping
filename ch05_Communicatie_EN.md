# Communication

A standard is a product, with all the related facets. In the same way that a product has a name, so does a standard. It is often an abbreviation, which is later a source of regret. For example if the technology becomes part of the name as is the case with all standardisation organisations with XML in their name; for example HR-XML Consortium. As the technology evolves, these organisations are forced to choose a new name (HR-XML is now known as HR Open Standards). This can be avoided, but it is more difficult to prevent the name becoming a reflection of the scope of the standard, so that it is also recognisable in practice. However, over the course of time, even the scope of the standard is bound to change so that the name no longer covers every aspect. Given these effects, a name that covers that broadest possible scope is advisable.

Another consideration when choosing a name is entirely practical: Is the domain name that accompanies the name of the standard still available? In practice, this often forms an obstacle.

Moreover, the image created by the name can vary widely; for the majority of people Floricom probably has a more refreshing feel than Stosag. The look and feel of the name must of course match the desired look and feel of the organisation; for example a reliable but more boring name is generally a good match with the look and feel desired for a standard. The look and feel or the branding for a standard will often contain such core values as reliable and innovative. If the branding is right, other organisations will be keen to join in and be happy to use the logo. A positive sign.

Besides choosing the name, another important element of communication is promotion. This certainly applies to new standards. After all, a new product will not always be automatically found by the consumer; it often requires a marketing campaign to create awareness. The same applies to a standard which demands that you consider the identity of the target group: is it the primary stakeholders or perhaps the software suppliers required to implement the standard? And will your promotion be focused on developers/boffins or the project leader/management layer? The one need not exclude the other, but different groups often require a different approach. If aiming at business, the attention is often shifted to the business benefits, efficiency, new market opportunities. For boffins, the aspects that require more focus are technical embedding/architecture, software components, validation, etc.

Promotion also involves building a community. The value of a good mailing list should never be underestimated. It grants immediate access to the community of users of the standard. A specific LinkedIn group can also be valuable. The essence is to be able to approach the target group directly, on your own initiative. Everything must of course be fully GDPR compliant, which in practice above all means that explicit permission must be requested before sending emails, including the reasons for seeking contact.

Another important aspect of communication is the publication approach. In todayâ€™s world, publishing only PDF documents is entirely outdated. Consequently every standard today must also have online documentation (via login or otherwise). Today we expect an online web environment that looks good and is easy to use. That same online environment can undoubtedly also be used for the development process of the standard. Online publication offers advantages in terms of providing implementation support, for example the possibility of directly displaying and linking implementation examples to a section of text from the online publication. More far-reaching is the impact on the standardisation process. For example, version management today can be carried out on individual sections of the document rather than versions of the standard always having to be related to the entire document.

Good examples are:

| Standard                                      | Publication method                                 |
| --- | --- |
| SETU                                           | Semantic Treehouse (web application)              |
| The Metamodel for information modelling (MIM) | Respec (Javascript library for W3C style HTML) |
| API Design Rules                               | Respec (Javascript library for W3C style HTML) |

A tip: because the standard must have a web presence, it is a relatively simple task to include a _news page_ on the website. With the very best intentions, new items often appear on the website in the beginning, but they tend to dry up as time goes by. It often looks clumsy if the latest news item on the site is more than a year old; this will reflect on the image of the standard. Avoid issuing news items unless you have organised a method according to which the flow of messages will not dry up within the foreseeable future.

Finally: It is good to organise a reporting point for complaints. No matter how effective you are as a management organisation, people may become dissatisfied. At the end of the day, a management organisation always benefits if an opportunity is provided for people to make their dissatisfaction known; this gives you an opportunity to respond. Dissatisfaction that remains simmering below the surface is far more difficult to tackle. Management organisations are often small but you must avoid a situation in which complaints about the manager must be submitted to that same manager. A better option is to appoint a member of the steering committee as complaints officer and to announce the name of the contact person for complaints via the website. Preferably an independent member.
